Smart system to organize personal and social information in the web.

Dear friends, @relja reminded me that we need to talk about our chapter :see_no_evil:
The next milestone is April 27th, where we need to have defined objectives and deliverables.
My initial suggestion for that list (that we can discuss here) is:

## Objectives
O1) Improve the way we track digital information both on our local machines and in the cloud, by leveraging the access to digital content that we were previously exposed to.
O2) Use social interaction as a means to improve personal information organization. 
O3) Explore the team personal interests in the context of the chapter, in order to sharpen our programming skills, and learn new things.

## Deliverables
D1) Documentation about the Team’s vision for a moonshot solution for information organization.
D2) Proposal for an UI (any combination of visual, aural or gestual — not neural, that would be too ambitious) interface between human users and the digital system for information organization and retrieval.
D3) Proposal for an Architecture that implements the vision described in D1 and D2.
D4) Proposal for an Algorithm that “reads” digital documents and creates a taxonomy (or ontology) that organizes the documents taking into consideration personal preferences and social interactions.
D5) Test plan for D2,D3 and D4.
D6) Proof-of-concept implementations for the system components described in D2, D3 and D4.
D7) Test results and performance evaluation for the components created in D6.
